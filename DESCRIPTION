Title: Fast and Versatile Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
Description: This is a package for Non-Negative Linear Models (NNLM). It implements
    fast sequential coordinate descent algorithms for non-negative linear regression
    and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). It supports mean square error and Kullback-Leibler divergence loss.
    Many other features are also implemented, including missing value imputation, domain knowledge integration,
    designable W and H matrices and multiple forms of regularizations.
