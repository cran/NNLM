NNLM-0.4.0: 2015-12-20
======================
- Re-designed interface of `nnmf`
- Re-designed all C++ codes for future extension
- Added sequential quadratic approximation to KL-divergence
- Integrated regularization into Lee's multiplicative algorithms
- More choices of algorithms for nonnegative linear model and renamed `nnls` to `nnlm`
- Removed `plot` method

NNLM-0.3.0: 2015-11-19
======================
- `nmf_partial` was updated to `nnmf_general`, with two more great features
	* NMF with masked entries in W and H forced to 0
	* Allowing missing values in matrix A, which is useful for missing
		value imputation and recommendation system.
- Add more potential applications on vignette

NNLM-0.2.0: 2015-11-08
======================
- NMF with partially known profiles, which can be used for 
	tumour content deconvolution with known health profile
- Updated vignette

NNLM-0.1.0: 2015-11-04
======================
- OpenMP support for multiple threading
- Added progression bar and keyboard interrupt
- Added a vignette

NNLM-0.0.2: 2015-10-31
======================
- A very fast non-negative least square solver `nnls`
- Non-negative matrix factorization using alternating NNLS and brunet
- Predict new coefficients from known profile discovered from NMF (`nnmf`)
